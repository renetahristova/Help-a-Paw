## Help-a-Paw
"Help a Paw" is a mobile application that allows you to send alerts about injured stray animals. Volunteers who are nearby will then receive a notification. The aim is to provide a more reliable and faster way to inform people about emergencies around them.

In the issues section you can find a small part of the test cases and bug reports that I wrote during my QA training, in total more than 100 for this mobile application.
